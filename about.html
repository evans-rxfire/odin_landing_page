                <p class="about-text">It seems like a odd name for a business. Is it a name, a city, or something else? Agarita is on of my favorite plants and I thought it would make for a good business name. Honestly, I just thought is sounded kind of cool. Combining something from the natural world with the digital world incalsulates what we are all about.</p>

                <h3 class="about-header">What is Agarita?</h3>
                <p class="about-text">Agarita is one of many common names for the small evergreen shrub <em>Mahonia trifoliolata</em>. This plant is found in the southwestern US, has waxy leaves with sharp spines, and produces small red edible fruits. What first brought the plant to my attention (besides the sharp spines) was the way it sounded when burned. It makes a very distictive sound that I have always thought was cool. Later on I learned about the fruits which are quite tasty and used for making jellies and wines. I have recently discovered that the small yellow flowers are very fragrant and will fill the air with a worderful aroma. You can learn more about agarita <a class="about-link" href="https://www.wildflower.org/plants/result.php?id_plant=matr3">here</a>. All in all, it has become my favorite plant of the Texas Hill Country. </p>
